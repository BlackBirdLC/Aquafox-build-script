Hello!

This package installs the MacPorts requirements to compile TenFourFox. It sets up MacPorts at the prefix "macports-tff". It will be used in the Build TenFourFox.app application that gets installed to the /Applications folder.

After it's done compiling, it should drop the built TenFourFox onto your desktop.

Please note that this toolkit is in no way associated with FloodGap.com or Dr. Cameron Kaiser. It is a project I created on my own to scratch my own itch of wanting an easier way to set all this up.

If you intend to distribute your own builds with this toolkit, please be sure to respect Dr. Kaiser's wishes by changing the name and icon of the application.

Enjoy!
