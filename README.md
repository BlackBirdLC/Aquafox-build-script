# Aquafox Build Script
The Aquafox Build Script is a customized version of the tenfourfox-toolkit-scripts that enables the building of Aquafox.

### Installation Steps:
1. **Install The Unofficial TenFourFox Toolkit**: Begin by installing [The Unofficial TenFourFox Toolkit](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/the-unofficial-tenfourfox-toolkit).

2. **Replace the build_tenfourfox script**: The only modification required is to replace your current `build_tenfourfox` script located in `/opt/macports-tff/bin/` with the one provided in this repository.

That's all, you can now easily build Aquafox with your TenFourFox build environment.

### Important Note for Leopard Users:
Building Aquafox on Leopard might not work as the script will try to find a nonexisting patch-file, this issue will be fixed in the future.
